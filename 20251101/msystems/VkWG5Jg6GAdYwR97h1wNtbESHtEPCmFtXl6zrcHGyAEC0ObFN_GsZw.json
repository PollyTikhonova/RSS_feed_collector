However, little is known about the association of vibrios with plants in brackish environments and their potential benefits. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on <i>Vibrio porteresiae</i> MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> and brackish-grown Pokkali rice as our research subjects for this study. MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> displays multifaceted plant beneficial traits, including nitrogen fixation, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase production, and zinc and tricalcium phosphate solubilization. Further, MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> efficiently colonizes the host roots and significantly improves the Pokkali rice growth in nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limiting brackish conditions, highlighting its plant growth-promoting ability, a trait previously not well recognized in vibrios. Additionally, MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> can utilize various carbon-rich substrates derived from plant roots, demonstrating its metabolic adaptation to the plant rhizosphere niche. Using <i>in planta</i> root transcriptome analysis and whole-genome sequencing, we provide the first insights into how MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> interacts with Pokkali rice in brackish conditions. Additionally, we have identified several genome features for a plant-associated lifestyle, previously unreported in this genus. These features include plant expansin, PEP-CTERM surface anchoring with exopolysaccharides, plant-associated Hrp-type three secretion system, ACC deaminase production, PQQ-independent glucose dehydrogenase pathway for phosphate solubilization, plant-derived sugar/organic acids utilization operons, carbohydrate utilization loci, and specific plant depolymerizing CAZymes. Notably, MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> lacks key genome features critical for the animal association. Overall, this study adds new knowledge in the field of <i>Vibrio</i> biology, especially <i>Vibrio</i>-plant beneficial interactions, a relationship largely underexplored.IMPORTANCEThe genus <i>Vibrio</i> comprises over 150 species of marine heterotrophic bacteria, many of which are opportunistic pathogens affecting humans and marine animals. Most research has predominantly focused on pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> species, often overlooking the significance of other <i>Vibrio</i> species inhabiting other ecological niches, such as plants, a relationship largely uncharacterized. This study focused on <i>V. porteresiae</i> MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> and its relationship with brackish-grown Pokkali rice. We discovered that MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> possesses multiple plant growth-promoting traits, effectively colonizes roots, and enhances plant growth in brackish conditions. Additionally, MSSRF30<sup>T</sup> possesses several genome features commonly associated with plant-microbe interactions, previously unrecognized in <i>Vibrio</i> species, and lacks features typically associated with animal interactions, underscoring its specialized adaptation for plant niches. For the first time, this study highlights the beneficial interactions between <i>Vibrio</i> and plants, emphasizing their role in promoting plant growth and health in brackish environments.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>\n          Keywords:\n        </strong>\n      PGPR; diazotroph; plant-associated Vibrio; plant-associated lifestyle; rhizosphere adaptation.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n  <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/disclaimer/\" target=\"_blank\">PubMed Disclaimer</a>\n</p>\n  <div>\n    <h2>\n      LinkOut - more resources\n    </h2>\n    <ul><li><h3>Full Text Sources</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00910-25?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\">\n                    Atypon\n                  </a></li></ul></li><li><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://assays.cancer.gov/non-CPTAC-3867\" target=\"_blank\">\n                    NCI CPTAC Assay Portal\n                  </a></li></ul></li></ul>\n  </div>\n  </div>",
