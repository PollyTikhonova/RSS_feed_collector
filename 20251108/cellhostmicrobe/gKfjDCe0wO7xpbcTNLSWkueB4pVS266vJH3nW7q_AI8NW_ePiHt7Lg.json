Microbial diversity broadens the metabolite pool, with each taxon contributing distinct compounds in varying proportions. In the human microbiome, high variability in consortial composition is largely compensated by similar metabolic functions across different taxa. However, the extent of compensation in lower diversity mouse models, and whether vivaria are metabolically equivalent, is unknown. We provide a searchable resource of microbiome composition variability across 51 murine vivaria and 12 wild mouse colonies worldwide, with vivarium-specific variants mapped according to predicted 3D structures for each microbial species. Our matched metabolomics data show that realized metabolic potential has relatively low variability, providing functional evidence for metabolic compensation. Additionally, variability is related to taxonomic composition rather than vivarium, revealing taxa-metabolite associations that are potentially relevant to phenotypic differences between vivaria. Collectively, this resource offers tools to strengthen microbiome studies and collaborative science.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>\n          Keywords:\n        </strong>\n      functional complementation; genome-scale model; metabolomics; metagenomics; sub-strain variants; wild mice microbiota.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Copyright © 2025 The Authors.
