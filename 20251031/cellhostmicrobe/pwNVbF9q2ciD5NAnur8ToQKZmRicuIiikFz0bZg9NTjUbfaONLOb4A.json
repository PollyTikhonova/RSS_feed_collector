To further examine this microbial community, we present the human reference oral microbiome (HROM), with 72,641 high-quality genomes from 3,426 species, including 2,019 previously unidentified species, improving metagenomic sequence read classification over existing catalogs. Notably, HROM unveils 1,137 previously uncharacterized candidate phyla radiation (CPR) species, establishing Patescibacteria as the most prevalent phylum in the oral microbiota and distinct from environmental Patescibacteria. Additionally, an oral CPR subclade is associated with periodontitis, complementing Porphyromonas gingivalis in predicting disease. Finally, comparing HROM with reference genomes of the gut microbiome reveals taxonomic and functional divergence between these microbiomes. HROM contains 42 ectopic oral species, and their relative abundance in gut microbiota is predictive of intestinal, cardiovascular, and liver diseases. Thus, HROM offers an expanded view of the oral microbiome and highlights the clinical importance of further examining the links between oral microbes and systemic disorders.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>\n          Keywords:\n        </strong>\n      human oral microbiome catalog; metagenome; microbiome; microbiome catalog; oral metagenome; oral microbiome.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.
