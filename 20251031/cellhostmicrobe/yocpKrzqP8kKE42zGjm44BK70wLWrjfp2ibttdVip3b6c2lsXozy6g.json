However, this defense relies on the presence of recognizable effectors in pathogens, which is often unpredictable during natural infections. To address this, we engineer plant endophytes, termed Sentinels, to heterologously express effectors that are recognized by the host's corresponding NLR. Using an OxyR regulatory circuit, effector expression is activated by reactive oxygen species-a common signal during pathogen infection. This circuit enables ETI activation against pathogens without recognizable effectors. Colonization by the sentinel bacterium slightly alters microbial abundance but maintains overall microbiota diversity and normal plant growth. We demonstrate the strategy's versatility by testing distinct effector-NLR recognition pairs in various plants against a range of pathogens. This strategy exploits the microbiota-host-pathogen interaction network to rapidly engineer a spectrum-expanded ETI, complementing synthetic microbial consortia for plant defense.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <strong>\n          Keywords:\n        </strong>\n      ETI; NLR receptor; disease resistance; effector-triggered immunity; genetically modified endophyte; microbial engineering; microbiota; nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor; plant defense.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.
