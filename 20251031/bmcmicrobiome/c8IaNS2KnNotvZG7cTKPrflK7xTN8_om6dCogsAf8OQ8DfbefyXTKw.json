  "title": "An innovative strategy for overcoming ultra-high ammonia nitrogen inhibition on anaerobic methanogenesis via stepwise domestication - Microbiome",
  "description": "Background The world is facing both an increasingly severe energy crisis and a growing problem of agricultural pollution. The utilization of agricultural waste by anaerobic digestion (AD), has received increasing attention. AD using representative waste cow dung results in total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) accumulation and inhibition of methanogens resulting in reduced CH4 production. However, there is a lack of highly efficient in-situ biological domestication strategies to enhance the TAN tolerance of methanogens in AD systems. Results In this study, an incremental approach to gradually increasing the TAN concentration has been used for overcoming the problem. The results showed that at an ultra-high concentration of 6124.09 mg/L TAN, a 48-day domesticated AD system functioned stably and the cumulative CH4 production reached 72.81 mL/g volatile solids, whereas the undomesticated AD system failed to produce CH4. After domestication, the lactate dehydrogenase concentration decreased to 96.44 ng/L and the adenosine triphosphate concentration increased to 48.77 nmol/L, confirming that microbial activity improved. Hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria were enriched, with Methanosarcina (79.73%) dominating the domesticated AD system, primarily Methanosarcina mazei. Metagenomic analysis showed that with two-component system enrichment, the key inhibited steps from glycerate-1,3P2 to pyruvate (2.498‰), and from acetyl-CoA and acetyl phosphate to acetic acid (1.141‰ and 0.798‰), as well as vital methanogenic genes mcrA (0.128‰), mcrB (0.127‰), and mcrG (0.065‰), were both enriched, which favored a stable methanogenic system. More importantly, this ultra-high resistance AD system also showed the potential to increase the CH4 production per unit substrate at the Minhe biogas plant with 24,000 m3 operation scale in Shandong Province, China. Conclusions Stepwise increase the TAN concentration is a novel method that was demonstrated to be a practical and sustainable way to overcome ultra-high TAN inhibition (6124.09 mg/L). During domestication, the two-component system may regulate the microbial collaborative network to ensure microbial activity and high abundance enrichment, thus potentially constructing a methanogenic system dominated by hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis, holding a promising application prospect. This study helped recognize the potential of methanogens in tolerating ultra-high inhibition and developed an achievable AD technology for robustly treating fecal residue and wastewater in practice.",

One of the most common and representative agricultural pollutants is cow dung (CD), and its random discharge or stacking will lead to a negative impact on the environment [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Park D, Barabad M, Lee G, Kwon S, Cho Y, Lee D, et al.

In order to reduce the harm of CD to the environment, anaerobic digestion (AD) has been used for CH<sub>4</sub> production from CD [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Rao P, Baral S.

Its combustion primarily produces CO₂ and H₂O, making it a cleaner energy source compared to fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wu H, Zhang H, Yan R, Li S, Guo X, Qiu L, et al.

The low-cost energy production obtained by converting waste CD into CH<sub>4</sub> becomes a more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, the AD using CD will cause total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) accumulation, and inhibit the methanogens, resulting in reduced CH<sub>4</sub> production [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wu H, Zhang H, Dong T, Li Z, Guo X, Chen H, et al.

To solve the problem of TAN inhibition, some physical and chemical methods were used to promote CH<sub>4</sub> production, such as adding struvite precipitation [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Romero-Güiza MS, Astals S, Mata-Alvarez J, Chimenos JM.

Also, TAN will be continuously released during substrate degradation, which will lead to long-term inhibition. These standard physical and chemical methods can only temporarily alleviate the problem of TAN inhibition promoting CH<sub>4</sub> production, but cannot fundamentally and continuously alleviate TAN inhibition.</p><p>The co-AD, which regulates stress resistance and alleviates TAN inhibition by mixing different substrates, has attracted widespread attention [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Peng Y, Li L, Yuan W, Wu D, Yang P, Peng X.

Nevertheless, whether co-AD using Livestock manure at 55 °C can tolerate high TAN stress (exceeding 6000 mg/L) needs explore.\n</p><p>It should be noted that the TAN accumulated in the AD process is divided into free ammonia (FA) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N. FA has high cell membrane permeability, which can accumulate in cells and destroy the proton balance inside and outside the cells, producing toxic effects on cells [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Park S, Bae W, Rittmann BE.

Since the penetrability and toxicity of FA can damage cellular structures, some studies have used FA-facilitated hydrolysis and microbial pyrolysis to promote H<sub>2</sub> production [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wang D, Duan Y, Yang Q, Liu Y, Ni BJ, Wang Q, et al. Free ammonia enhances dark fermentative hydrogen production from waste activated sludge.

Excessive FA can kill methanogens, and is regarded as the most inhibitory nitrogen. pH is a key factor affecting the balance of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and FA conversion [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Li J, Xu K, Liu T, Bai G, Liu Y, Wang C, et al. Achieving stable partial nitritation in an acidic nitrifying bioreactor.

Although adjusting pH can reduce the concentration of FA, it will lead to an increase in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N concentration. Although this NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N can also inhibit biogas production, its toxicity to methanogens is weaker than that of FA. FA ranging 30 to 300 mg/L will lead to microbial toxicity whereas TAN will have inhibitory effect when it is as high as 1000 mg/L [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Yellezuome D, Zhu X, Wang Z, Liu R.

Therefore, controlling pH under acidic conditions to ensure the activity of methanogens is the key premise to achieving TAN tolerance at ultra-high concentration.</p><p>However, determining how to improve the tolerance range of AD to achieve ultra-high concentration TAN tolerance is a difficult challenge. Biological domestication has attracted attention Due to its ease of operation and no need for bioaugmentation agents. However, the period required for microorganisms to gradually adapt to high TAN concentrations relying on their own metabolism can be up to 120 days [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wilson L, Loetscher L, Sharvelle S, De Long S.

More importantly, the microbial response characteristics and functional gene regulation mechanism of the AD process need to be analyzed in detail.</p><p>In this study, WAS was used as the inoculum and CD was used as a substrate for AD. In order to improve the TAN tolerance of the co-AD system, the TAN tolerance of the methanogenic process was improved by gradually increasing the TAN concentration under acidic conditions.

As shown in Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig2\">2</a>d–f, the VFAs peak in the first stage of CKG and TDG reached 293.44 and 208.70 mg/L, and then decreased to 224.39 and 190.28 mg/L, respectively, showing similar VFA production performance. However, in the second stage, VFAs in TDG were up to 728.92 mg/L, whereas VFAs in CKG were only 306.48 mg/L, indicating that VFAs began to accumulate due to TAN inhibition. Figure <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig2\">2</a>c shows that the concentration of COD in TDG was higher than that in CKG, indicating that VFAs were produced from excessive organic matter but the CH<sub>4</sub> production process was TAN inhibited, leading to VFAs accumulation. At the end of the second stage, the VFAs concentration of CKG and TDG decreased to 87.26 mg/L and 113.77 mg/L, respectively, indicating that TDG can utilize VFAs without causing a large amount of VFAs accumulation. The similar phenomenon also occurred in the subsequent stages 3–6 (Fig. S1e). It should be noted that the VFAs in CKG were mainly acetic acid and other VFAs remained in low concentrations. The accumulation of VFAs, particularly acetic acid, is primarily due to the inhibition of their downstream metabolic conversion pathways.</p><p>Further, we evaluated the CH<sub>4</sub> production performance. As shown in Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig2\">2</a>g, in the first stage in CKG, CH<sub>4</sub> production peaked at 43.37 mL/g VS whereas in TDG it peaked at 48.01 mL/g VS. However, in the second stage, the CH<sub>4</sub> production in TDG was less with a maximum of only 37.99 mL/g VS being lower than the 52.07 mL/g VS in CKG, indicating that the CH<sub>4</sub> production activity was inhibited by ultra-high TAN concentrations, which explains the accumulation of VFAs. The inhibition of TAN on TDG also appeared in the subsequent stages 3–6. It is important to note that the AD process is always accompanied by the release of H<sub>2</sub>. However, both the daily H<sub>2</sub> production and cumulative H<sub>2</sub> production in CKG were lower than those in TDG (Fig. S2), indicating that H<sub>2</sub> may be used by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Figure <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig2\">2</a>h shows that the CH<sub>4</sub> accumulation of CKG in stages 3–6 was stable between 113.41 and 126.75 mL/g VS, whereas that of TDG was stable between 72.81 and 88.40 mL/g VS. The stable accumulation of CH<sub>4</sub> in stages 3–6 confirms the stability of the TDG. Therefore, although it was lower than CKG, a continuous and stable TAN tolerance system was achieved in the TAN domestication process to achieve CH<sub>4</sub> production under ultra-high TAN concentration.</p><p>To verify the tolerance performance of TDG, the TIG with 6000 mg/L TAN and without TAN domestication was compared. As shown in Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig2\">2</a>, although the average concentration of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N (5964.27 mg/L) and FA (98.22 mg/L) was similar to the concentration TDG, its COD concentration (3276.15 to 4923.02 mg/L) and VFAs (247.76 to 1606.28 mg/L) remained higher, indicating that the organic matter utilization was inhibited. In addition, the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid in TIG were 790.43, 433.99, 182.55, and 6.59 mg/L, respectively, indicating that its acetogenic process was more significantly inhibited by TAN than TDG and CKG. The accumulated high concentration of VFAs will also synergistically inhibit the methanogenesis process with an ultra-high concentration of TAN [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tian H, Karachalios P, Angelidaki I, Fotidis IA.

As a result, TIG could not produce CH<sub>4</sub>, so it is not included in Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig2\">2</a>h.</p><p>Therefore, although the AD performance of TDG was slightly weaker than that of CKG, the AD system with ultra-high TAN (6124.09 mg/L) tolerance and stable CH<sub>4</sub> production through TAN domestication was achieved. This technology has the potential to break through the bottleneck of synergistic inhibition of TAN and VFAs caused by AD of raw materials containing ultra-high TAN concentration.</p><h4 id=\"Sec17\">Evaluation of the inhibitory effect of total ammonia nitrogen on different stages of anaerobic digestion process</h4><p>In order to verify whether TAN only inhibits the acetogenic and methanogenesis process rather than the hydrolysis process, degradation analysis of model substrates at various stages of the AD process was performed. Macromolecular substances can only be further utilized by microorganisms after being hydrolyzed into small molecules. Dextran was used as the model substrate (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig3\">3</a>a). Its removal rate of TDG and TIG with 6000 mg/L TAN were 97.21% and 98.72%, respectively, whereas that of CKG was 100% without TAN. The hydrolysis performance of the three groups was similar, indicating that the hydrolysis process was little affected. Glucose could be used to produce VFAs, representing acidogenic process (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig3\">3</a>b). The glucose removal rates of TIG and TDG with 6000 mg/L TAN were 98.57% and 98.66%, respectively, which were similar to 98.61% of CKG without additional TAN, indicating that the acidogenic process was less affected. After glucose is metabolized, it is first converted into butyric acid, which serves as a precursor of acetic acid and indirectly affects methanogenic potential [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wang Y, Zhao J, Wang D, Liu Y, Wang Q, Ni B-J, et al. Free nitrous acid promotes hydrogen production from dark fermentation of waste activated sludge. Water Res. 2018;145:113–24. \n                  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.011\n                .\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#ref-CR40\">40</a>]. Using sodium butyrate as a model substrate can help determine the acetate production efficiency and verify whether it limits methanogenesis. As shown in the Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig3\">3</a>c, the removal rate of sodium butyrate in CKG was 99.57%, whereas that of TDG was only 83.52%, and that of TIG was 73.89% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), indicating that the acetic acid production process was inhibited, and the acetic acid production performance of TDG was better than that of TIG. Further, acetic acid can be used as the main substrate in the methanogenic process of methanogenesis, and the effect of TAN on this process was also evaluated (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig3\">3</a>d). The removal rate of sodium acetic acid in CTG and TDG was 84.42% and 73.38%, which was better than TIG without TAN domestication (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), indicating that TAN would lead to the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis, whereas domestication could improve its tolerance. The inhibitory effect of TAN on the methanogenesis process was stronger than that on the acetogenic process. In addition, acetate, H<sub>2</sub> and methanol are key substrates for the methanogenic process and the CH<sub>4</sub> production from their metabolism can be used for a detailed assessment of the potential for these pathways. However, CH₄ can only be produced when acetate and H₂ are used as substrates in TDG, yielding 7.40 and 8.58 mL of CH₄, respectively, whereas methanol does not produce any CH₄ (Fig. S3). This indicates that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis primarily contribute to CH<sub>4</sub> production, followed by acetoclastic methanogenesis.</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Fig. 3</b></figcaption><div><div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y/figures/3\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40168-025-02255-y/MediaObjects/40168_2025_2255_Fig3_HTML.png?as=webp\"></source><img src=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40168-025-02255-y/MediaObjects/40168_2025_2255_Fig3_HTML.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" /></picture></a></div><p>The performance verification of each stage of anaerobic digestion. <b>a</b> The degradation rate of dextran in three systems, <b>b</b> the degradation rate of glucose in three systems, <b>c</b> the degradation rate of sodium butyrate in three systems, and <b>d</b> the degradation rate of sodium acetate in three systems. <i>TDG</i> total ammonia nitrogen domestication group, <i>CKG</i> control check group, <i>TIG</i> total ammonia nitrogen inhibition group.

However, the LDH concentrations of both TDG and CKG continued to decrease, and the damage to the microbial system was gradually reduced, indicating that TAN domestication could improve tolerance. According to the comparison of LDH concentration regression equation, it could be seen that the tolerance of TDG can be achieved faster. The LDH concentration at stage 4 was similar to that in the first stage of CKG, indicating that TAN domestication not only improved tolerance but even conferred the potential of TDG to surpass CKG. ATP is involved in energy transfer between microorganisms and can characterize the activity of microbial systems [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wang D, Wang Y, Liu L, Chen Y, Wang C, Li YY, et al.

During the TAN domestication process, the ATP concentrations of CKG and TDG continued to increase, and the metabolic activity of the microbial system gradually increased, indicating that the metabolic activity was also enhanced while the tolerance of the microbial system was improved. From the ATP concentration regression equation, it is evident that the growth rate of TDG activity was faster and the ATP concentration in the stage 4 was consistent with the CKG concentration. In order to verify the acclimation effect, TIG was tested. The LDH and ATP of TIG were 97.71 ng/L and 42.74 nmol/L, respectively, with TAN inhibition, which showed higher cytotoxicity and lower energy than CKG and TDG. This suggests that TAN can lead to low CH<sub>4</sub> production by inhibiting microbial activity of acetogenic microorganisms and methanogenic microorganisms. Therefore, although TAN induced cytotoxicity and reduced energy levels in microorganisms, the TAN domestication process can enhance the adaptability of microorganisms to TAN, thereby reducing stress responses. This is another reason for maintaining the continuous production of CH₄.</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Fig. 4</b></figcaption><div><div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y/figures/4\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40168-025-02255-y/MediaObjects/40168_2025_2255_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp\"></source><img src=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40168-025-02255-y/MediaObjects/40168_2025_2255_Fig4_HTML.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" /></picture></a></div><p>Microbial activity analysis. <b>a</b> Lactate dehydrogenase concentrations in three systems, and <b>b</b> adenosine triphosphate concentrations in three systems. <i>TDG</i> total ammonia nitrogen domestication group, <i>CKG</i> control check group, <i>TIG</i> total ammonia nitrogen inhibition group</p></div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y/figures/4\"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div><h4 id=\"Sec19\">Bacterial community responses to total ammonia nitrogen domestication process</h4><p>The hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes in the AD system are primarily regulated by the bacterial community, necessitating analysis.

The effect of FA on these three genera would thus extend to a broader microbial community, including <i>Izemoplasmatales</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, <i>Proteiniphilum</i>, <i>DMER64</i>, <i>Tepidiphilus</i>, <i>Haloplasma</i>, <i>Caldicoprobacter</i>, <i>Fastidiosipila</i>, <i>Synergistaceae</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, <i>Treponema</i>, <i>Halocella</i>, <i>D8A-2</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, <i>Fermentimonas</i>, and <i>Hydrogenophaga</i>. This positive correlation can be attributed to the adaptation of low-concentration FA by the microbial synergistic network. The release of nitrogen during the hydrolysis process may also contribute to this significant positive correlation. In addition, there was a negative correlation between the FA and another microbial community, which was composed of <i>Rhodothermaceae</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, <i>HN-HF0106</i>, <i>Limnochordia</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, <i>Fibrobacterales</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, and <i>Firmicutes</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, indicating the TAN sensitivity of these genera.

There was a significant correlation with FA and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, indicating that the microbial community might be resistant to ultra-high concentrations of TAN, which belonged to the dominant microbial community under ultra-high TAN conditions. Compared with CKG, the change of microbial collaborative network in TDG was not only affected by FA, but also by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N. The association of <i>Synergistaceae</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, <i>Caldicoprobacter</i>, <i>Proteiniphilum</i>, <i>Fermentimonas</i>, and <i>DMER64</i>, which are involved in the construction of coexisting networks, did not change, indicating that they were the key functional genera under TAN tolerance.</p><p>Overall, the driving factors of the microbial collaborative network in the TAN domestication process was confirmed as FA and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N.

In addition, there were acetoclastic methanogens <i>Methanothrix</i> (1.47% to 3.38%) and <i>Methanosarcinales</i>_<i>unclassified</i> (0.24% to 0.66%). This is considered to be a reason for the reduction in organic matter concentrations, achieved through the enrichment of methanogens that produce CH<sub>4</sub> from acetic acid. It is worth noting that the TAN domestication process could increase the abundance of <i>Methanosarcina</i> under the ultra-high TAN concentration condition, indicating that TAN domestication successfully constructed a compound methanogens pathway that could tolerate TAN. The community structure at the species level found to follow a similar trend, confirming the dominance of <i>Methanosarcina</i> (Fig. S4a). Further metagenomic binning analysis identified that the key archaeal species enriched in TDG is <i>Methanosarcina mazei</i> (Fig. S5, Table S1), which is consistent with that in CKG.</p><p>However, there were differences in the archaea community in TIG, mainly <i>Methanosarcina</i> (34.93%), and the secondary archaea community was mainly hydrogenotrophic methanogens <i>Methanoculleus</i> (11.86%), <i>Methanobacterium</i> (18.43%), <i>Methanobrevibacter</i> (1.24%), and <i>Methanocorpusculum</i> (10.30%). Only <i>Methanothrix</i> (7.13%) was found to be an acetoclastic methanogen. The low abundance of <i>Methanosarcina</i> and acetoclastic methanogens in TIG indicates that AD would be inhibited by TAN without TAN domestication, which was consistent with the conclusion in Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig2\">2</a>.

This would have been mainly due to the lack of H<sub>2</sub> as a substrate supply (Fig. S2a). In addition, Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig4\">4</a> reveals that TAN may lead to low activity of bacteria and archaea in AD system, which was also one of the reasons. Therefore, the abundance of the dominant <i>Methanosarcina</i> had an enrichment trend similar to that of CH<sub>4</sub> production, indicating it may be a potential key genus regulating CH<sub>4</sub> output. However, the key methanogenic pathways with high contribution still need to be identified in combination with gene abundance.</p><p>A key question is do archaea communities also have symbiotic relationships driven by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and FA.

There is a complex material exchange and symbiotic relationship between methanogens [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Du J, Yin Q, Zhou X, Guo Q, Wu G.

In addition, the collaborative network in TDG at the genus level is mainly composed of <i>Methanobacterium</i>, <i>Methanobrevibacter</i>, <i>Methanomicrobiaceae</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, <i>Methanothrix</i>, <i>Methanocorpusculum</i>, <i>Methanosarcinales</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, <i>Methanomicrobia</i>_<i>unclassified</i>, and <i>Methanoculleus</i> (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig6\">6</a>c), which is similar to the network at the species level (Fig. S4c). However, this archaea community was negatively correlated with TAN and <i>Methanosarcina</i>, confirming that <i>Methanosarcina</i> can withstand ultra-high TAN levels.</p><p>Therefore, the collaborative network of archaea was also driven by FA and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, but <i>Methanosarcina</i> could tolerate TAN without the collaborative network.</p><h4 id=\"Sec21\">Effect of total ammonia nitrogen Domestication on acetic acid production process</h4><p>It is important to know in which vital step TDG achieves tolerance to TAN in acetogenic process. Glycolysis is the primary acetogenic pathway, as shown in Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig7\">7</a>.

This indicated that this pathway of TDG and TIG were both uninhibited. In addition, α-<span>d</span>-glucose-1P can be degraded to α-<span>d</span>-glucose by glucose-1-phosphatase encoded by the <i>agp</i> and <i>yihX</i> genes, and then to β-<span>d</span>-glucose by aldose 1-epimerase encoded by <i>galM</i>.

Subsequently, α-<span>d</span>-glucose-6P was degraded into β-<span>d</span>-glucose-6P by repressed genes <i>GPI</i>, <i>pgi1</i>, <i>tal-pgi</i>, and <i>pgi-pmi</i> genes encoding glucose-6-phosphate isomerase.

It is worth noting that the high abundance of genes of TDG in these processes were responsible for the realization of tolerance.</p><p>There were also pathways to inhibit significantly, that is, all genes obtained a lower abundance than CKG. The abundances of <i>fbaB</i> encoding fructose-bisphosphate aldolase of TIG in the degradation pathway of β-<span>d</span>-fructose-1,6P2 to glyceraldehyde-3P decreased to 0.070‰, which was lower than TDG6 (0.180‰) and CKG1 (0.099‰), indicating that <i>fbaB</i> may be the key gene for resistance to TAN. During the degradation of glycerate-1,3P2 regulated by <i>PGK</i> encoding phosphoglycerate kinase to glycerate-3P, the abundance of TIG (0.885‰) was lower than that of TDG6 (0.890‰) and CKG1 (0.909‰). In this step, TDG also achieved functional gene enrichment. Glycerate-3P was degraded to pyruvate by <i>PGAM</i>, <i>gpmB</i>, <i>apgM</i>, <i>ENO</i>, and <i>PK</i> genes encoding phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphopyruvate hydratase, and pyruvate kinase. The abundance of these genes in TIG was 2.323‰, which was lower than CKG1 (2.646‰) and TDG6 (2.498‰), confirming the tolerance of TDG6 in this step. Additionally, in the acetyl phosphate to acetic acid step regulating by <i>ackA</i> encoding acetate kinase, the abundance of TIG was only 0.736‰, which was lower than that of CKG1 (0.795‰) and TDG6 (0.796‰). The enrichment of genes involved in the above steps (whole process of glycerate-1,3P2 to pyruvate) was confirmed to be the main reason why TDG had tolerance to TAN to produce acetic acid. The abundance of acetyl-CoA regulated by <i>ACSS1</i>_<i>2</i>, which encodes acetyl-CoA synthetase, was also enriched in TDG6.</p><p>Therefore, TAN domestication could enrich the genes that regulate the TAN-inhibited pathway from glycerate-1,3P2 to pyruvate and the steps from acetyl-CoA to acetic acid, which may construct a stable acetic acid production process.</p><h4 id=\"Sec22\">Effect of total ammonia nitrogen domestication on CH<sub>4</sub> production process</h4><p>Another important question is which is the main methanogenesis pathway to achieve tolerance to TAN in TDG.

The specific pathway was from acetate to 5-Methyl-H4MPT regulating by mainly <i>ackA</i>, <i>cdhC</i>, and <i>cdhD</i> genes encoding acetate kinase and acetyl-CoA decarbonylase. Their abundances in TIG were 0.736‰, 0.038‰, and 0.095‰, respectively, which were lower than TDG6 (0.796‰, 0.050‰, and 0.112‰) and CKG1 (0.795‰, 0.052‰, and 0.098‰). This indicated that the acetoclastic methanogenesis in TIG was inhibited but in TDG was enhanced. It is worth noting that the abundance of <i>ACSS1</i>_<i>2</i> regulating acetate to acetyl-CoA in TDG was as high as 0.947‰, which was higher than 0.896‰ in CKG1. The steps regulated by <i>ACSS1</i>_<i>2</i> and <i>cdhE</i> may be the main pathways of acetoclastic methanogenesis in TDG under TAN inhibition. This pathway synergistically produces CH<sub>4</sub> alongside the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis confirmed by Fig. S3.</p><p>The final CH<sub>4</sub> production processes of the three pathways are similar. In the process of 5-Methyl-H4MPT to CH<sub>4</sub>, <i>mtrC</i>, <i>mtrD</i>, <i>mtrE</i>, <i>mtrF</i>, <i>mtrG</i>, and <i>mtrH</i> genes encoding tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase were inhibited, and their total abundance in TIG was 0.282‰, which was lower than 0.367‰ in TDG6 and 0.386‰ in CKG1. However, as the final step of methanogenesis, the key genes <i>mcrA</i>, <i>mcrB</i>, and <i>mcrG</i> encoding methyl-CoM reductase were 0.096‰, 0.098‰, and 0.041‰ in TIG, which were lower than TGD6 (0.128‰, 0.127‰, and 0.065‰) and CKG1 (0.148‰, 0.141‰, and 0.070‰). These three genes only existed in methanogens were enriched by TAN domestication process but still lower than CKG1, indicating that it might be an important process limiting CH<sub>4</sub> production.</p><p>Thus, acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was considered both dominant in the TAN domestication system. The step regulated by <i>mcrA</i>, <i>mcrB</i>, and <i>mcrG</i> genes encoding methyl-CoM reductase may well be the key step for CH₄ production.</p><h4 id=\"Sec23\">Mechanism of total ammonia nitrogen domestication to construct a stable synergistic system of acetic acid and CH<sub>4</sub> production</h4><p>Through the above discussion, it is evident that TAN domestication can enhance microbial activity and enrich functional bacteria and genes, but the reasons for these changes need to be considered. The effect size of linear discriminant analysis can reveal the pathways and modules leading to significant differences in AD systems by calculating the score of linear discriminant analysis. The quorum sensing, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, ABC transporters, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, carbon metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and CH<sub>4</sub> metabolism in the TAN domestication process were confirmed to be the main reasons for the differences in TDG (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig9\">9</a>a), which indicated that the utilization and transmembrane exchange of small-molecule organic matter, as well as the methanogenic process, were all enhanced. In addition, two-component system also leaded differences during TAN domestication process. The two-component system is a mechanism for bacteria to adapt to the selection pressure by sensing the changes in the external environment, regulating survival and the expression of virulence factors [<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Zhu Y, Han Y, Liu G, Bian Z, Yan X, Li Y, et al.

The two-component system may be a key regulator of organic matter metabolism during the TAN domestication process. However, key metabolic functions involved in methanogenesis did not have high linear discriminant analysis scores in TIG.</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Fig. 9</b></figcaption><div><div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y/figures/9\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40168-025-02255-y/MediaObjects/40168_2025_2255_Fig9_HTML.png?as=webp\"></source><img src=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40168-025-02255-y/MediaObjects/40168_2025_2255_Fig9_HTML.png\" alt=\"figure 9\" /></picture></a></div><p>Identification of key enrichment factors driven by total ammonia nitrogen domestication. <b>a</b> The top 20 pathways with high linear discriminant analysis scores, <b>b</b> the top 20 modules with high linear discriminant analysis scores, and <b>c</b> the mechanism of total ammonia nitrogen domestication relieving inhibition of ultra-high concentration total ammonia nitrogen. <i>TDG</i> total ammonia nitrogen domestication group, <i>CKG</i> control check group, <i>TIG</i> total ammonia nitrogen inhibition group</p></div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y/figures/9\"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div><p>Figure <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig9\">9</a>b shows that the enrichment of lysine biosynthesis module (M00527, M00526, M00525, and M00016) provided a contribution to the differences among the samples in TDG.

The glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (M00001, M00003, and M00002) was enriched, indicating that the hydrolytic and acidogenic process was promoted. In addition, the high abundance of pyruvate oxidation (M00307) indicated that the acetogenic process was strengthened.

Thus, this further confirms that the two-component system during TAN domestication maintained microbial metabolic activity, thereby achieving stable CH₄ production under ultra-high TAN inhibition.</p><p>As shown in the Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig9\">9</a>c, the microbial mechanisms by which TAN domestication alleviates inhibition are summarized. Specifically, the AD system process gradually adapted to the increasing TAN concentration by enriching the two-component system to regulate microbial metabolism and collaborative network in TAN domestication process. In this process, microbial activity was improved, and hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria dominated by <i>MBA03</i>_<i>unclassified</i> and archaea dominated by <i>Methanosarcina</i> were enriched. In addition, the TAN-inhibited steps of acetic acid production (from glycerate-1,3P2 to pyruvate and from acetyl-CoA and acetyl phosphate to acetic acid) and CH<sub>4</sub> production [from 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonate to CH<sub>4</sub>] processes were also alleviated. These reasons together led to the stable production of CH<sub>4</sub> in TAN domestication. However, TIG did not produce CH<sub>4</sub> because an ultra-high concentration of TAN completely inhibited microbial activity, acetic acid production and methanogenesis.</p><h4 id=\"Sec24\">Engineering application potential and implications</h4><p>To evaluate the application potential of TAN domesticated AD system, the Minhe biogas plant (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-025-02255-y#Fig10\">10</a>a, b), with 24,000 m<sup>3</sup> operation scale, was used to compare with the TAN domesticated AD system.

The similar TAN load and microbial community functions of this biogas plant practically confirms the application potential of domesticated AD system developed in this study. Although the CH<sub>4</sub> production in this study was only 72.81 mL/g VS, which is lower than the 310 mL/g VS of the Minhe biogas plant.

An ultra-high concentration of TAN could poison microorganisms and inhibit the acetogenic and methanogenic stages of the AD process, whereas the TAN domestication process could alleviate the toxicity of TAN and enrich acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea <i>Methanosarcina</i> (primarily <i>Methanosarcina mazei</i>). Further, the limiting steps from glycerate-1,3P2 to acetic acid and from 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonate to CH<sub>4</sub> were both have been enriched During the TAN domestication process, which could potentially contribute to the construction of a stable methanogenic system dominated by both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis. Additionally, the two-component system may regulate microbial metabolism activity and collaborative networks to adapt to the increasing TAN concentration, such that microorganisms and genes might be enriched. Importantly, applying this strategy to the Minhe biogas plant with a capacity of 24,000 m<sup>3</sup> may increase the CH₄ production per unit of substrate, presenting potential for improving economic efficiency. This study proposes a novel short-cycle, high-performance TAN domestication strategy that can stimulate multiple methanogenic pathways to achieve stable CH<sub>4</sub> production. This strategy holds significant value as a reference for large-scale agricultural waste resource recovery plants worldwide.</p><p>Building on this work, future research should focus on exploring the feasibility of tolerating higher TAN concentrations.
