We identified all genomic intervals with substantial fold changes in H3K27Ac signal between PDAC tumors (<i>n</i> = 6) and normal adjacent tissue (<i>n</i> = 4; Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig1\">1a</a>). A median of 65,010 H3K27Ac peaks per sample (range = 43,909–76,827) was observed. Enriched enhancer regions, specifically in primary PDAC lesions, are presented in Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig1\">1a</a>, and we termed these sites as PDAC-enriched candidate regulatory elements (PDAC-CREs). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed a substantial H3K27Ac divergence between tumors and the adjacent normal tissue (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig1\">1a</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig8\">1a,b</a>). Differential transcription factor binding at the tumor-specific regions was assessed using the cistrome DB toolkit, an approach that identifies binding site similarity with known experimental transcription factor datasets (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig8\">1c</a>), with FOXA1 being the top correlated transcription factor from published ChIP–seq datasets. Analysis of the H3K27Ac sites showed that the most enriched motifs within all experimentally mapped enhancer elements from patient samples were hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) motifs (HNF4G and HNF4A) and Forkhead (that is, FOXA1; Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig1\">1a</a>), confirming that these two classes of transcription factors constitute the lineage-defining factors in these patient tumor samples. The analysis of clinical datasets revealed that HNF4A levels did not differ between normal and primary tumor samples but were modestly increased in metastatic samples. In contrast, we observed elevated HNF4G levels in primary tumors compared to the normal adjacent tissue, but surprisingly HNF4G mRNA levels in metastases were closer to those observed in normal tissue (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig1\">1b,c</a>)<sup><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Moffitt, R.

A comparison of HNF4G ChIP–seq from normal adjacent tissue (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig1\">1e</a>) showed that tumor-specific enhancers were occupied by HNF4G.

This was applied to two classical (HPAF-II and AsPC-1) PDAC cell line models (where HNF4A and HNF4G are highly expressed) and one mixed subtype model as a control (Miapaca-2; Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2c</a>, Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig8\">1g</a> and Supplementary Table <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#MOESM2\">1</a>). After FOXA1-RIME, we identified numerous subunits of the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF complex, known NR cofactors, including CBP, NCOA3 and NCOR1/NCOR2, as well as GATA6 (ref. <sup><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Papachristou, E.

Notably, this suggests that FOXA1 is present in both major molecular subtypes of PDAC and many of the FOXA1-associated coregulatory proteins were the same, except for HNF4A and HNF4G, which were only seen as FOXA1-associated proteins in models of the classical subtype of the disease. We validated this observation in additional models (Supplementary Table <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#MOESM2\">1</a>)<sup><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bailey, P. et al.

To confirm that HNF4A and HNF4G were in a complex with both of the metastasis-associated transcription factors, FOXA1 and GATA6 (ref. <sup><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Martinelli, P. et al.

The genomic binding profiles and physical interactions among HNF4G, FOXA1, HNF4A and GATA6 were validated in additional models of the classical subtype (Extended Data Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig8\">1h</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig9\">2a</a>).</p><p>We hypothesized that FOXA1 was the PF for HNF4G (and possibly HNF4A), as seen with other NRs in breast and prostate cancer that require FOXA1. However, our in vitro data suggest that, although HNF4G was consistently required for viability of classical PDAC cell line models (Extended Data Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig9\">2e–j</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig10\">3a,b</a>), FOXA1 was not required. These data imply that FOXA1 might not be the PF for HNF4G, because depletion of FOXA1 should phenocopy HNF4G depletion. We also explored GATA6 as a potential PF for HNF4G, but silencing of GATA6 did not result in decreased HNF4G binding sites (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig9\">2c</a>) and instead depletion of GATA6 resulted in substantial gains in HNF4G binding sites, suggesting that GATA6 could be a negative regulator of HNF4G activity. We also found little evidence that HNF4A was required for the growth of classical models (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig9\">2e–j</a>). We, therefore, focused on HNF4G as a chromatin regulatory protein and specifically silenced HNF4G and subsequently conducted the assay for transposase accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC–seq; Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2d</a>). We found 5,203 regions that were closed and 4,275 regions that were opened after HNF4G depletion. We could also confirm that the HNF4G-dependent chromatin accessibility regions were adjacent to the HNF4G-dependent target genes (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2d</a>), suggesting that HNF4G is responsible for creating the enhancers that drive the target gene expression events. Therefore, HNF4G is required for maintaining chromatin accessibility and HNF4G activity is not dependent on FOXA1 or on GATA6.</p><h3 id=\"Sec5\">HNF4G mediates primary tumor growth but suppresses metastatic genes</h3><p>We sought to explore the role of HNF4G in more complex tumor models of human disease. CRISPR knockout (KO) clones were generated in the HPAF-II cells (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig10\">3d</a>). We orthotopically injected HNF4G-KO pooled clones or control cells into the pancreas of NOD SCID-γ (NSG) mice and observed a significant increase (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0006) in the median survival of mice bearing HNF4G-KO tumors compared to control tumors (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2e</a>).

We conducted RNA-seq on the orthotopic tumor samples (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig10\">3f–j</a>) and identified an HNF4G-specific target gene signature that was assessed in the PanCuRx clinical cohort<sup><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chan-Seng-Yue, M. et al.

The HNF4G target genes that were differentially expressed in the PanCuRx primary tumor samples were adjacent to the genomic regions that were ‘opened’ by HNF4G in our cell line models (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2d</a>, red panel above MA plot), confirming that HNF4G mediates chromatin accessibility at gene targets that are commonly expressed in patient samples.</p><p>The findings show that FOXA1 cobinds with HNF4G in the classical subtype of PDAC, but that FOXA1 is not a PF in this PDAC subtype and, instead, the key transcription factor driving primary tumor growth appears to be HNF4G. Thus, HNF4G can induce chromatin opening at the target genes that are consistently expressed in patient primary tumor samples, but these genes are decreased in expression in metastases, mimicking the expression profile of HNF4G mRNA (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig1\">1b</a>).</p><h3 id=\"Sec6\">PRMT1 is a substantial, functional interactor of HNF4G</h3><p>HNF4G is a poorly studied NR, and it is currently classified as an ‘orphan’ NR, because no endogenous ligands have been implicated for these orphan receptors<sup><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Isigkeit, L. &amp; Merk, D.

These data suggest that both transcription factors contribute to overall survival from PDAC, with FOXA1 mediating metastatic potential and HNF4G mediating primary growth, and possibly growth at secondary sites as well.</p><h3 id=\"Sec8\">HNF4G restricts the transcriptional activity of FOXA1</h3><p>To date, our data suggest that HNF4G is the primary driver of tumor growth, whereas FOXA1 becomes the driver of metastasis, and together, they both contribute to tumor progression and overall survival. To understand how a functional switch occurs from HNF4G-dependent state to a FOXA1-mediated metastatic state in the transition from primary tumor growth to metastatic progression, we explored our engineered human cancer cell line xenograft models. We performed RNA-seq on the collected primary tumors from the pancreatic orthotopic experiment, as well as FOXA1 ChIP–seq and ATAC–seq to map chromatin accessibility (Extended Data Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig11\">4k</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig5\">5a–c</a>). We observed a gain of 4,940 de novo FOXA1 binding sites when FOXA1 was overexpressed compared to EV (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig12\">5a</a>). These sites correlated with regions that were already open and accessible, as measured by ATAC–seq (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig12\">5b</a>), implying that an increase in FOXA1 levels results in opportunistic binding to regions that are already euchromatic and FOXA1 cannot create new enhancers, as would be expected from a genuine PF. Unexpectedly, no differential gene expression changes were observed after FOXA1-OE (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig12\">5f–h</a>), despite the gain in FOXA1 binding sites. When HNF4G was silenced, however, 2,133 of these gained FOXA1 binding sites (following FOXA1-OE) became transcriptionally active (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig5\">5a,b</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig12\">5c–e</a>), suggesting that the presence or absence of HNF4G dictates whether FOXA1 is active at these regions or not (Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig12\">5i,j</a>).</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Fig. 5: Functional FOXA1 binding in the absence of HNF4G.</b></figcaption><div><div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7/figures/5\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41588-025-02389-7/MediaObjects/41588_2025_2389_Fig5_HTML.png?as=webp\"></source><img src=\"https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41588-025-02389-7/MediaObjects/41588_2025_2389_Fig5_HTML.png\" alt=\"figure 5\" /></picture></a></div><p><b>a</b>, ChIP–seq heatmap represents coverage intensity in EV, FOXA1-OE, HNF4G-KO and HNF4G-KO + FOXA1-OE at 2,133 functional sites. <b>b</b>, Complex visualization of functional connection between FOXA1 occupancy and gene ontology groups in proximity to the functional binding sites.

We term these ‘HNF4G-restricted FOXA1 metastasis genes’. These HNF4G-restricted FOXA1 metastasis genes were correlated well with the gene expression profiles of metastatic patient samples (mets) when compared to a cohort of classical subtype primary tumor samples (from the PanCuRx dataset; Extended Data Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig12\">5m</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig13\">6a</a>), validating the conclusion from the preclinical models.</p><h3 id=\"Sec9\">HNF4G dependency to FOXA1-driven metastatic transition</h3><p>Up to this point, our data suggest that HNF4G is the driver in primary contexts, and it also restricts FOXA1’s metastatic activity. We speculated that HNF4G’s ability to restrict FOXA1 could be compromised in advanced disease, where metastatic target genes become induced by FOXA1. Analysis of the human PanCuRx dataset showed a global decrease in HNF4G mRNA expression in metastatic samples (mets) relative to primary tumors, with a coincident increase in FOXA1 expression (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig5\">5d</a>). We also conducted IHC of HNF4G and FOXA1 from primary tumors and relatively rare metastatic human tissue (two independent cohorts). In primary tumors, we observed clear expression of HNF4G and FOXA1, which was restricted to the epithelial compartment and predominantly exhibited nuclear expression (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig5\">5e</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig13\">6b–d</a>). When we assessed the metastatic patient samples, we observed a consistent expression of FOXA1. However, in two independent cohorts, we observed either decreased HNF4G protein expression or cytoplasmic HNF4G staining in metastases, which was not observed in primary tumor samples (Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig5\">5e</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig13\">6b–d</a>).

Although transcription factors in the past have been considered ‘undruggable’, NR transcription factors constitute realistic drug targets due to the presence of a ligand-binding pocket in the protein. To this end, our new insight reveals the NR HNF4G as a key driver in the primary tumor growth. Currently, HNF4G-targeted drugs do not exist and HNF4G is an orphan NR with no known endogenous ligand. One possibility is that HNF4G might lack an endogenous ligand and could have evolved as an NR-related transcription factor that does not functionally require the conserved ligand-binding domain. Alternatively, there could be an endogenous ligand for HNF4G that is a noncanonical compound. In support of this, X-ray crystallographic structures of HNF4G have revealed a common long-chain fatty acid, palmitic acid, occupying the ligand-binding domain pocket of HNF4G in these structures and palmitic acid has previously been shown to influence PDAC tumor growth and metastatic potential<sup><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Binker-Cosen, M.

Sensitivity analyses, considering Wald <i>t-</i>tests based on a log-normal model and Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests, led to the same conclusions.</p><h4 id=\"Sec34\">Growth curves</h4><p>In Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2c</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig4\">4b,e</a>, we used parametric linear mixed models to fit tumor sizes of mice on the cube root (Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2c</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig4\">4b</a>) and log plus 1 (F3k) scale as a function of groups and time. These transformations were selected to obtain a linear relationship between tumor size and time on the transformed scales and to tame heteroscedasticity. In each analysis, groups (considered as factor with a reference group), time (in days) and groups interacting with time were used as fixed effects. Random intercepts (Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2c</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig4\">4b</a>) and slopes (Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2c</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig4\">4e</a>) were used to take the longitudinal within-mouse tumor size dependence into account.</p><p>In Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2c</a>, the difference in growth between the control and HNF4G-KO groups was assessed by means of a likelihood ratio test comparing the likelihood (of the maximum likelihood estimator) of a restricted model assuming the same average growth for both groups and a full model that allows both groups to have a different average growth.</p><p>In Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig4\">4e</a>, given the delayed growth of the HNF4G groups compared to the control ones, we opted for a piecewise mixed model that allows for the modeling of this time lag, whose value was obtained by minimizing the Akaike criterion. Inference for the parameters related to the growth time lag between the HNF4G and control groups, as well as the difference in growth between each group and HNF4G-KO-GSK, was based on Wald <i>z</i> tests, considering a multiplicity correction for parametric models (function glht of the R multcomp package).</p><p>In Figs. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig2\">2c</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig4\">4e</a>, models were fitted using standard R routines (function lme of the nlme R package). In Fig. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#Fig4\">4e</a>, due to the combination of small sample size per group and the presence of left truncation, we used an estimator based on the iterative bootstrap. This allows us to correct for a potential left-truncation bias and to perform a finite sample correction for the parameters. Its initial estimator was a random slope model with the fixed effects described above and a linear interpolation of left-truncated observations. Two-sided inference for the target parameters considered a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.</p><h3 id=\"Sec35\">Reporting summary</h3><p>Further information on research design is available in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02389-7#MOESM1\">Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary</a> linked to this article.</p></div></div>\n                </div><div>\n                <div><h2 id=\"data-availability\">Data availability</h2><p>All ChIP–seq, Hi-ChIP, ATAC–seq and RNA-seq data have been deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus and can be accessed at GEO submission (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE245734\">GSE245734</a>).
